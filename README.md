A project meant as a gift for a friend to display where they have been around the world!

## A Note On Contributions: 
 Contributions are closed right now due to this being a personal project. However during production I might be inclined to add more users to the project
 
## A Note On Purpose:
This project was meant as a gift. The overall application is supposed to display Google Maps Icons around the world with descriptions as to where you have been around the world. This isn't meant for production, however, the project is currently in production due to my friend needing to have access to it whenever needed.
